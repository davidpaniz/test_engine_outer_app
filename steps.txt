rails new my_app
cd my_app
rails g scaffold post title:string body:text
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
#started app with rails s and created 2 posts

#create the engine. Out of the my_app dir run:
rails plugin new shared_model
#create the model dir. Inside the engine dir run:
mkdir app/models/shared_model/
#move the post model. If the both projects root_dir are in the same directory, run inside the app dir:
mv app/models/post.rb ../shared_model/app/models/shared_model/

#edit model to add module in class file

#generate migration to rename class
rails g migration rename_posts_to_shared_model_posts
#all work here is done. Now, back to outer app

#install the engine into vendor/engines as a git submodule
mkdir vendor/engines
git submodule add git@github.com:davidpaniz/test_engine_shared_model.git vendor/engines/shared_model

#configure Gemfile adding: gem 'shared_model', path: 'vendor/engines/shared_model'
#probably some bug, but I had to update rails version to 3.2.3 and run a bundle update

#rake db:migrate does NOT run engine migrations, so we have to copy them with the following command:
rake shared_model:install:migrations

#edit PostsController and add the module prefix SharedModel to all references to Post class.

#runs the app again and everything should be working as well before the update
